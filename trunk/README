1) Run the cleanup_v0.7.sh first (using sudo) to perform the required clean up 
   tasks under:
  - /usr/bin/samurai, 
  - /home/samurai/tools, and 
  - the Applications menus

$ sudo ./cleanup_v0.7.sh

  *** You need to log out for the gnome-terminal profiles to be populated ***
  *** after completing this step.                                          ***


2) After running the clean up script, and following the log out indications, 
   you can install the new SVN infrastructure by running the following script:

$ sudo ./install_samurai_svn.sh


3) You can install new tools into Samurai, or update current ones not available
   from SVN, by using the following setup script:

$ sudo ./install_samurai_setup.sh


4) Run the set_samurai_version.sh script to update the README and CHANGELOG
   files with the lastest updates associated to the current SVN version:

$ ./set_samurai_version.sh


*** 
    Do not forget to release some disk space by deleting the current directory,
    obtained from the official Samurai-WTF SVN, as it is not required anymore.
