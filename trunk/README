- Run cleanup_v0.7.sh first (using sudo) to perform the required clean up 
  tasks under:
  /usr/bin/samurai, 
  /home/samurai/tools, and 
  the Applications menus:

$ sudo ./cleanup_v0.7.sh

- *** You need to log out for the gnome-terminal profiles to be populated ***

- After the clean up and logging out, you can install the new SVN 
  infrastructure by running the following script:

$ sudo ./install_samurai_svn.sh

- Do not forget to release disk space by deleting the current directory,
  obtained from SVN, as it is not required anymore.
